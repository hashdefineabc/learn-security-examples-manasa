- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


1. The vulnerability is that it cannot match the action performed by the user as user's actions are not logged.
The secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version because it has a middleware that loggs the incoming request details.

2. We can add authentication secure the log files from unauthorized access.
