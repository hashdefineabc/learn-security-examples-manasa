Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.
The problem happens when the system doesn't clean up the "name" property properly before using it. This lets attackers sneak in harmful code, which could mess up the system's security.

To fix this, the secure version makes sure to clean up all the information it gets before using it. This stops the attackers from slipping in harmful code and causing trouble.
